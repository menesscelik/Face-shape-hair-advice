# **Face Shape Detection and Hairstyle Recommendation**

This project is a MATLAB-based application designed to detect face shapes from images and provide personalized hairstyle recommendations. It utilizes deep learning techniques and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Face Shape Detection**: Uses a pre-trained Inception-v3 model to identify face shapes (e.g., Heart, Rectangular, Oval, Round, Square).
- **Personalized Hairstyle Recommendations**: Provides suggestions based on detected face shapes.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Allows users to upload an image and interactively view results.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

1. MATLAB (R2021a or later is recommended).
2. `Deep Learning Toolbox` for training and using deep learning models.
3. Required project files:
   - `createGUI.m`: GUI for the application.
   - `detectFaceShape.m`: Code for detecting face shape.
   - `suggestHairStyle.m`: Provides hairstyle recommendations based on face shape.
   - `untitled2.m`: Script used for training the deep learning model.
   - Pre-trained model: `inceptionv3_face_shape_model.mat` (can be generated by running `untitled2.m`).

```

## Usage

### Step 1: Train the Model
Run the `untitled2.m` script to train the Inception-v3 model using the dataset in the `FaceShape/train` directory. The trained model will be saved as `inceptionv3_face_shape_model.mat`.

```matlab
>> untitled2
```

### Step 2: Launch the Application
Run the `createGUI.m` script to start the GUI. This interface allows users to upload an image, detect face shape, and receive hairstyle recommendations.

```matlab
>> createGUI
```

### Step 3: Upload an Image
1. Click the **"Upload Photo"** button.
2. Select an image file (e.g., `.jpg` or `.png`).
3. The detected face shape and recommended hairstyles will be displayed in the application.

## Key Files

### `createGUI.m`
- Initializes the GUI.
- Allows users to upload images.
- Displays detected face shape and recommendations.

### `detectFaceShape.m`
- Loads the pre-trained model (`inceptionv3_face_shape_model.mat`).
- Detects the face shape from the uploaded image.

### `suggestHairStyle.m`
- Provides hairstyle recommendations based on detected face shape.

### `untitled2.m`
- Trains the Inception-v3 model using the dataset.
- Saves the trained model for later use.

## Dataset
The dataset should be organized as follows:

- **Training Data**: Stored in `FaceShape/train`. Images and labels are defined in `_classes.csv`.
- **Validation Data**: Stored in `FaceShape/valid`.
- **Test Data**: Stored in `FaceShape/test`.

Each `_classes.csv` file should be structured as follows:
```
filename,Heart,Oblong,Oval,Round,Square
image1.jpg,1,0,0,0,0
image2.jpg,0,1,0,0,0
...
```

## Future Improvements
- Support for more face shapes and hairstyles.
- Improved face shape detection accuracy using a larger dataset.
- Extended GUI functionality to allow saving results.
